# exactsim5361

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of exactsim5361 is to generate simulations from the exponential 
distribution using the inverse method.

## Installation

You can install the development version of exactsim5361 like so:

```{r}
remote::install_github("exactsim5361")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the simexp function to simulate
1000 from an exponential distribution with parameter lambda equal to 3:

```{r example}
library(exactsim5361)
## basic example code
simexp(n = 1000, lam = 3, seed = 12345)
```
